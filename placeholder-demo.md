# Creating a Demo GIF

Since we can't directly create a GIF in this environment, you'll need to record your application in action. Here's a simple process:

1. Run your application locally (`npm run dev`)
2. Use a screen recording tool to capture the key features:
   - Real-time price updates
   - Filtering and sorting
   - Theme switching
   - Starring cryptocurrencies
   - Responsive design

3. Convert the recording to a GIF using a tool like [ezgif.com](https://ezgif.com/video-to-gif)
4. Save the GIF as `demo.gif` in the root directory of your project
5. The README is already set up to display this GIF

## Example Demo Script

1. Start with the application loaded in dark mode
2. Show the real-time price updates for a few seconds
3. Switch to light mode to demonstrate theme switching
4. Filter by "Top Gainers" and then "Top Losers"
5. Sort by different columns (price, market cap, etc.)
6. Star a few cryptocurrencies and then filter by "Starred"
7. Resize the browser window to show responsive design

This will create a comprehensive demo that showcases all the key features of your application.
